this is a motherfucking stopwatch. and it's fucking perfect. 

i needed a very simple stopwatch that would work on the playstation vita web browser. this is what claude 3.5 sonnet came up with, as that was somehow easier than finding one on google that didn't have useless shit like a cookie banner and even functioned on an ancient browser. god i fucking hate modern web devs.
